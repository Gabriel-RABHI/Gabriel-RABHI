As a developer with proven capabilities in business, strategic, and technological analysis, I offer a unique and atypical profile. My journey began at age 18 when I created a video game for Mindscape (then part of the Pearson group). Driven by a passion for R&D, I am self-taught in programming languages such as Pascal, C, C++, and C#, as well as in software architecture and framework design. My creative pursuits have also extended to 2D/3D computer graphics (bitmap, vector, modeling, rendering, and animation with Maya) and multimedia production (sound, video, motion graphics), including music composition from my first years and in home studio later. This diverse skill set provides me with a comprehensive technical foundation for my primary focus: software architecture and development.

With knowledges in psychology, I am recognized as a perceptive manager who can produce clean, expressive, and well-illustrated documentation that guides developers toward clear and understandable goals. Having been self-employed for many years, I have collaborated with numerous contractors on long-term projects and value working as part of a team. My varied professional experiences have given me a keen insight into corporate dynamics, strategic challenges, and business expectations. This perspective allows me to align effectively with senior management, even while maintaining high standards. I am adept at managing long-term, multi-dimensional projects.

I have been a SCRUM team member and I consistently review industry best practices like DDD, TDD, and the SOLID principles. I actively monitor architectural trends, including CQRS and Event Sourcing - patterns I have implemented as lead developper for large scale systems. My greatest professional satisfaction comes from designing innovative architectures that deliver maximum business value and meet market needs.

I am motivated by stepping outside my comfort zone, embracing challenges, and deploying bold solutions. Since 2010, one of my primary research projects has been a high-performance persistent object repository for .NET, inspired by “Big Memory” and High-Performance Computing (HPC) concepts. My past projects include developing several engines from the ground up: a distributed database, a graphical user interface engine, 3D engine, and between 2014 and 2020, a full-stack social networking engine (HTML5/JS/CSS) featuring a proprietary web server, NoSQL/Graph database, and text indexing (WAH). While not a mathematician, I have a strong intuition for computational possibilities and am creative in challenging the state-of-the-art, particularly interested in areas like .NET application scalability, lock-free concurrency, and managing terabytes of objects in RAM without Garbage Collector pauses.
