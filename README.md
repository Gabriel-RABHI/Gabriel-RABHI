My name is Gabriel RABHI. I am what we usually describe as an atypical developer. Creator of a video game at 18, Al Unser Jr Arcade Racing (Mindscape Bordeaux, Pearson group at the time), passionate about software Research & Development, I am a self-taught programmer (Pascal, C, C ++, C #) and something like a “software architect”. For the past decade, one of my main research topics has been a high-performance distributed (server-to-server) object repository for .Net : it is a low-level, low-tech “Big Memory” system. It replace separated DBMS : in (virtual) memory objects are the data, not a temporary copy of the data. It's a big change : there's no more pull and push.

In the past, I have developed several engines: distributed database, graphical interface, small 3D engines. Since 2014, I maintain a (dirty and risky) social network engine: full hand made Web Stack, HTML5-JS-CSS, hand made Web server (parsing the frames), embedded design language, NoSQL and Graph DBMS, textual indexing like Lucen, etc. It was a great experience. Creative, I am also 2D and 3D graphic designer (bitmap, vector and modeling, rendering, animation under Maya and ex-Alias), multimedia (sound, video, motion graphics) and incidentally, composer (conservatory, home studio).

The variety of my professional experiences has given me some understanding of what a business is – small ones first. I collaborated with several entrepreneurs. I can apprehend complex projects, requiring a strategic vision, technological innovations and long-term work. Taking advantage of my graphic and multimedia background, I can design product with decent UI/UX. I have practiced SCRUM and I am attentive to the practices of the industry (TU, DDD, TDD, Event Sourcing, CQRS, MVU, etc).

Coming out of my comfort zone, taking up challenges and deploying bold approaches is a real driving force for me – and honestly, it’s not without risk ! But learn to manage risks is a key for innovation.
