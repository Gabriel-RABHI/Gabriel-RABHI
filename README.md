My name is Gabriel RABHI. I am what we usually describe as an atypical developer. Creator of a video game at 18, Al Unser Jr Arcade Racing (Mindscape Bordeaux, Pearson group at the time), passionate about software Research & Development, I am a self-taught programmer (Pascal, C, C ++, C #) and something like a “software architect”. Creative, I am also 2D and 3D graphic designer (bitmap, vector and modeling, rendering, animation under Maya and ex-Alias), multimedia (sound, video, motion graphics) and incidentally, composer (conservatory, home studio).

The variety of my professional experiences has given me some understanding of what a business is – small ones first. I collaborated with several entrepreneurs. I can apprehend complex projects, requiring a strategic vision, technological innovations and long-term work. Taking advantage of my graphic and multimedia background, I can design product with decent UI/UX. I have practiced SCRUM and I am attentive to the practices of the industry (TU, DDD, TDD, Event Sourcing, CQRS, MVU, etc).

Coming out of my comfort zone, taking up challenges and deploying bold approaches is a real driving force for me – and honestly, it’s not without risk. For the past few years, one of my main research topics has been a high-performance distributed (server-to-server) object repository for .Net, in the “Big Memory” spirit. In the past, I have developed several engines: distributed database, graphical interface, 3D engine. Since 2014, I maintain a social network engine: full Web Stack, HTML5-JS-CSS, Web server, hand maid NoSQL and Graph DBMS, textual indexing like Lucen, etc.
